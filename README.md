Welcome to the GitHub repository for the group project from the course Introduction to Digital Humanities and Social Analytics. Here, you will find information regarding our project focusing on the dataset [Crime at Sea: A Global Database of Maritime Pirate Attacks (1993–2020)]( https://github.com/newzealandpaul/Maritime-Pirate-Attacks). The research question what we are focussing on is:
>To what extent does Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product correlate with the rate of piracy attacks on the country between 1993 and 2019?

  
Additionally, we provide insights into our project workflow and presentation of the article:
Atteveldt, Wouter van, and Tai-Quan Peng. ‘When Communication Meets Computation: Opportunities, Challenges, and Pitfalls in Computational Communication Science’. *Communication Methods and Measures 12*, no. 2–3 (3 April 2018): 81–92. DOI: 10.1080/19312458.2018.1458084.

### Github overview
Our repository contains of four folders.
1)	Logbook
2)	Presentation
3)	Project proposal and teamcharter

The [logbook](https://github.com/marleen101/Introduction-to-digital-humanities-and-social-analytics_group3/tree/main/Logbook) contains of folders of dates where we had a meeting, in the folders are files of what we did in those meeting, like what did we changed. It is our workflow documentation. This is done to ensure our transparency of the workflow.

The folder [Presentation](https://github.com/marleen101/Introduction-to-digital-humanities-and-social-analytics_group3/tree/main/Presentation) contains of a pdf-file of our presentation slides we used with our presentation about the article ‘When Communication Meets Computation: Opportunities, Challenges, and Pitfalls in Computational Communication Science’. Furthermore, there is a file which worked as our base of our presentation. Also the presentation of our final project is in this folder. 


Lastly, [Project proposal and teamcharter](https://github.com/marleen101/Introduction-to-digital-humanities-and-social-analytics_group3/tree/main/Project%20proposal%20and%20team%20charter) contains the files of our team charter (information about the team members of the group and rules we made within the project) and the project proposal (what we want to do with our project). There is also a final draft of the two files combined, which we had to hand in in the course. However, the file with the project proposal was written for an initial idea we had for our project, which isn't the final direction we went. That project proposal was focussed on a different research question. To know more about our change of direction, look in the folder [logbook](https://github.com/marleen101/Introduction-to-digital-humanities-and-social-analytics_group3/tree/main/Logbook) at the date **2024-09-27** and **2024-09-30**. 


The file `Project Documentation` is an important file in our github repository. The file states an overview of our project, workflow steps, our result of the project and reflection.

# A New Hope

##### We should move past our criticism (for now) and focus on how we CAN use our dataset

### So far: 
Savio: Made an extractor, counts entities in a csv file so we can quickly look through the data for some early orientation and can be expanded upon if needed later on

9.5 proposal (note: we asked for their permission to have a look to learn what we can improve in our project): https://github.com/Yulivu/Introduction-to-Digital-Humanities-and-Social-Analytics-Group7 

### Discussion:
- We need to define: corruption index and decide which factors of the corruption index we will look at. 
- External or internal validity? Steps that we take, can be replicated by others. - There is a need for further research - we need to specify and be transparent so that there is replicability
- Great recession: 2008, world wide event - check global and local correlations 
- 1993 - 2019: as much as data points we have 
- Causation or correlation - correlation

#### Keep in mind:
- Keeping it simple
- We’re drifting away from our dataset
- Why Somalia and Yemen (article back-up, data-based)
- Why 2008 and 2012: Since there is a spike in attacks around these years
- Why economic status (article back-up)
- How will we do it:
- Is this pattern still valid to this day?

=> Make groups - see what differences there are between the different groups
=> use secondary literature to possibly explain differences 

##### Examples of such groups/categorization: 
- Geographical location (north, east - continent - country as a whole)
- Economic status
- Unemployment rate
- Corruption index
- GDP
- Military funding 
(keep in mind limitations such as social attitudes towards violence and corruption)
- Political structure 
- Years (available data)

##### 2015 - 2019
- top 10 countries nearest to pirate attacks in the span of the years
- Many missing data: incomplete reports? 


### Instructions: 
#### The documentation should contain:
- Project Overview. A Brief description of the project’s purpose and objectives, including RQ and thesis statement;
- Data Acquisition. This includes the description of the dataset used (e.g., source and provenance of the data, any data preprocessing steps taken;
- Methodology. This is a detailed explanation of the methods and tools used. It must include a justification for the chosen methodologies and a Work Packages or division of tasks among team members;
- Workflow Steps. This is a step-by-step description of the workflow from data collection to analysis. It includes a description of software and tools used at each stage, key decisions made and their rationale, any alternative approaches considered and why they were not chosen;
- Challenges and Solutions. This is a description of any challenges encountered during the project and the strategies used to address these challenges;
- Ethical Considerations. This is a discussion of ethical issues related to data use, privacy, and bias and a documentation of how these issues were managed;
- Results. This is a summary of the findings and how they were derived, including a connection between the findings and the initial research question;
- Documentation and Sustainability. These are the instructions for accessing the project's data and code (e.g., links to repositories like GitHub) and a description of how the project’s outputs can be maintained or reused in the future;
- Reflection. This is a reflection on the workflow’s effectiveness and any lessons learned, including suggestions for future improvements or research directions.


#### The presentation should contain:
- An Introduction with a brief background about the project (e.g., context);
- A short explanation of the project’s objectives (i.e., RQ, thesis statement);
- The project's workflow;
- A description of the dataset including limitations; 
- A description of the methodology, including Work Packages, aka division of tasks;
- A discussion of your findings (analysis and interpretation of the results);
- A discussion of the relevance of your findings, limitations and future work;
- A brief description of the team.

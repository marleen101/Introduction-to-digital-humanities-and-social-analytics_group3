#### Workflow steps:
Monitoring

#### Description:
Issues with variables: change from CPI to GDP, reasoning: Before 2012, the CPI was measured relative to other countries, so comparing their CPI scores across the years would be meaningless. After 2012, the CPI measurement changed, making it possible to compare themselves across the year. 
=> This may risk our loss of usable data. Suggestion: Change the country indicator to GDP (more objective)

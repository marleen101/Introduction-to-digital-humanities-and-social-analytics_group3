## Relevance 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In Crime at Sea, Benden et al. state that their dataset offers a reuse potential that could serve well to gain a deeper understanding of the place, time and reason for pirate attacks.
Researchers, anti-piracy organizations, and corporations dealing with maritime transport, for example, could use the dataset.[^1] They could use the data to look at patterns and predict pirate attacks in order to prevent it, since pirate attacks are increasing again.[^2] 
The metadata contained within the dataset, however, lacks an explicit description of the contents, categorizations and terminology used.[^3] This leads us to question, to what extent do the categories and terms present within our dataset align with categories and terms used in research on pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden.[^4] 
## Thesis Statement
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To gain a better insight of the accessibility of the terminologies, we will contrast the terms used within the dataset with existing research in regards to (specify type of research) pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden.[^5] By understanding the frequency of the use of certain terminologies we can draw a conclusion on how accessible the dataset is to the intended users. Our comparison will highlight that there are many defining features of maritime pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden throughout different studies. 
## The Dataset
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The dataset is collected from Benden et al.[^6] It consists of three relational data sets with multi-faceted information about piracy attacks, country codes, and some indicators of the countries involved. 
The original dataset of piracy attacks was pulled from the International Maritime Bureau. The other datasets were pulled from The World Bank, Transparency International and Government Revenue Dataset. The data is highly reliable due to the credibility of the sources.  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;However, three considerable limitations would hinder our ability to perform informative research. Firstly, the dataset is incomplete and has many missing values. For example, in the data concerning different measurements regarding each country over the year, there are 2522 and 2479 missing values on the column “corruption_index” and “homicide rate,” respectively, out of 5899 values. We acknowledge that if we remove every missing value in the dataset, we would lose nearly half of the original dataset. A reason for this issue is the fact that the dataset was partly collected from another research and partly web-scraped. The misalignment between two sources and the incompleteness of each data source would result in this problem. Secondly, we recognize that the categories are ambiguous in some variables, and the dataset owners do not report detailed descriptions of each variable. Finally, the dataset owners do not clearly specify the contextualization of the data collection from the original sources. The expectation is that the lack of clarity and transparency hinders future researchers and us from reusing the dataset.

## The plan
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To compare our dataset with others and compare commonly used categories and terms, we would need to use text mining techniques or go through the relevant datasets that other research used, to create a database to compare our dataset with. We can then judge whether the missing values end up being detrimental and if the other datasets can enrich our current one.
## Team chart
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our group aims to create an open, equal, safe space where everyone collaborates to learn DH & SA joyfully and complete a successful project. We plan to have tasks completed two days before the deadline and to meet at least one day before submitting the final draft.   
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We are eager to explore the field of DH & SA, benefit from its interdisciplinary nature, and apply the knowledge to our own studies. Our strengths come from our diverse academic backgrounds and personalities. However, a big and diverse group can lead to challenges like communication issues, having different goals and taking more time for decisions. Open communication allows us to address these challenges. To leverage each other’s strengths, we divide tasks fairly, seek feedback and share our expertise to enhance collective understanding. We learn from one another by asking questions, sharing opinions without judgment, and engaging in discussions together. For communication, we use WhatsApp with a maximum response time of one day, and meet weekly on Wednesdays to review our progress.
### Suggested workflow: 
- Define scope of the research that is taken into account
- Define parameter of date and subject that the research treats
- Define parameter of date and subject that our dataset treats
- Define subcategories of research (Example: does the research use/references one of the databases used for the data set. e.g. IMB)
- Determine overlap/alignment
- Determine inconsistencies/misalignment
- Interpret data
- Discuss strengths and limitations
- Draw conclusion
- Structure findings in a visualization
- Suggest further research opportunities

[^4]:The Gulf of Aden is chosen as a geographical focus, because our dataset currently seems to have the most data on this area and this area is connected to extensive research. This may change/become more specified after further research.

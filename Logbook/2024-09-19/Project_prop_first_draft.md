## Project Proposal 

1) The project proposal is max 800 words. 
2) The project description must contain: 
  - a research question (RQ): max 2 sentences
  - a thesis statement
  - a description of the dataset
  - an action plan
  - a team chart

The relevance of the RQ should be based on a minimum of 3 articles/books on the topic;
- What has been done so far on this topic?
- Is there a gap we can identify?
- How recent/dated is the field?
- What can we contribute?
- Will there be innovative aspects? Which ones?

The thesis statement is the solution/answer to the RQ that you want to investigate;
- (Maybe) in a single sentence: the problem, solution, and 'plan'
- The formulation process can be continuously improved, but starting with a tentative statement (hypothesis) from small to big.
- SMART principles: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely (why now?)

The dataset you will use to answer/investigate your RQ should be problematized (e.g., what are the advantages and limitations of the dataset?);

A short description of how you think you need to process, model, and expand the data based on your RQ (use the data scope steps and/or Template_Dataset_evaluation.docx* -> See Template dataset

Clear references to the literature you used in an official academic style;

Think of the the team charter as your team's log. It should describe the team members (i.e., composition, backgrounds, academic disciplines, etc.), clearly state deliverables and deadlines, foreseen and actual challenges and opportunities, potential pitfalls, means of collaborations and communications, frequency of meetings, division in work packages, timeline, and so on. 


## Template for assignment Dataset evaluation for research

### Dataset
Evaluating a dataset for answering research questions can be subdivided into different steps
that move from the dataset to formulating a research question that you want to answer with it
to the plan you make to answer the research question. They are outlined below. For the
assignment, make a document in which you answer these questions.
- What is the nature of the dataset you want to use;
- What is it about;
- Where does it come from;
- Who made it;
- What is the size;
- Which variables does it contain;
- What technical format is it in, can you handle that, or can you transform it to a format
you can handle;

### Research question
- What sort of questions (related to your research) could you use this dataset and for
what sort of questions is it unusable.
- (Re)formulate your research question so that you can answer it with the dataset.
*Note:
You may need to reconsider this point when you make your plan because working with the data will
give you new insights.*
- If necessary (it usually) is, subdivide it into smaller questions and steps that you can
answer directly with the dataset

### Plan
- Are the data in the dataset complete and consistent enough to give reliable answers to
the main question and the sub-questions you formulated? If not, how can you make it
more consistent, or can you think of ways to get missing information?
- Can you answer your question straight away, or do you need to do it in different steps
(this is usually the case). Specify them as separate operations and answer the questions
on the transformations below on them.
- What transformations does your dataset need to prepare it for automatic processing?
Think of:
  - Selecting the data: throwing away parts of the set before you start processing
because they are not complete enough, do not fall into the limits of you
research question for some reason etc.
  - Modelling: are the data in the form required for your research question or do
they need to be remodelled? This can be simple transforming them into
another format, or discarding parts of the data that are not relevant to answer
your question.
  - Normalization: of dates, of persons, titles, words etc. What variation is
important, and what should be eliminated? What happens if you do not
normalise?
  - Linking different types of data within the dataset or with other information
elsewhere
  - Classifying: are the data too complex to answer your questions and can they be
classified into different types. On what grounds? Try to find formal
classifications
  - Definitions for the classifications. Can the classification be performed by an
automated process, or should you do it manually, or a combination of both

Please note:
- This evaluation template is a practical tool designed to make a systematic evaluation. It does not include
selecting a dataset for your research, let alone trying to formulate research questions as such. Obviously, these
are important steps as well, but they fall outside of the scope of this document
- Remember that a dataset can usually be used to answer many more questions than you can come up with. This
template is meant to answer a specific research question. Do not try to be complete beyond that, as it will only
confuse you.
- The questions are meant to make you think (in a systematic way) about a dataset in relation to your research.
Treat them as such, not as a questionnaire

# Documentation 
1. Data problems
- The datasets were second-hand, web-scraped, and incompleted when merged together => There are several NAs on the data, prevent our group from eliciting many insights from them.
- The categories remained vague and the dataset providers did not make the definitions clear: suspicious attack? boarded and boarding?
2. Familiarzing with the data
- There is a huge increase in piracy attacks around the period 2008 - 2012 (based on the data)
- Gulf of Aden has been a hot location when it comes to piracy (back up article needed)
- Somalia and Yemen have significant piracy attacks records
- Contextualization
3. Ideas
- Economic factors influencing the rate of piracy attacks in some countries around the Gulf of Aden
- East of Aden, population => compare the events, insights: how future piracy can happen. 
- Criminology theories in application to the project
4. Primary RQ: Effect of economic status Somalia and Yemen on their rate of piracy attacks near their countries between 2008 and 2012. 
- Why Somalia and Yemen (article back-up, data-based)
- Why 2008 and 2012: Since there is a spike in attacks around these years
- Why economic status (article back-up)
- How will we do it: 
- Is this pattern still valid to this day?
5. Extra ideas
- Media coverage
- Civil wars
- Define the dataset, access to more data to see the categorization and definition. Suggestion for future data documentation.
- Check on other maritime piracy research to see what factors they focus on
- Text mining, frequency, call for more useful and explicit data collection => enhance usability
### Idea 
We look at categories being used in the data set, and how other current research categorize their data to check on their alignment, and how to make the dataset more usable in future research. 
The users have different way of categorizing than research. 
How do researchers talk about the data that they use for investigating piracy attacks and compare with current dataset. 
#### RQ: To what extent do the categories and terms present within our dataset collaborate with categories and terms used in research done on pirate attacks in the gulf of Aden?
- Need to specify dating, categories.

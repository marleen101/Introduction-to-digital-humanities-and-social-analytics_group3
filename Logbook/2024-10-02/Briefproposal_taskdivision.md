## Brief proposal
### Relevance of RQ
- How will it help? Society/science: usefulness 
- Test dataset - cause it is quite new - sake of science
- predictive values - future piracy, what to expect
- preemptive measures - different trade routes, reaction against corruption, expectations and risk factoring 
- Use the new dataset to study more explicitly correlate the rate of corruption and piracy attack 

### Thesis statement
By analyzing the data of the (insert crimes at sea) and correlating it with the corruption index of (specify). 
We expect to observe a relatively strong correlation between corruption rate and the number of piracy attacks in Nigeria over the years between 1993 and 2019. 

### Approach & Methodology
- statistical method (27 data points < n = 30) -> limitation
- line graph (normally distributed? Matched pairs? random? quantitative data)
- maybe look at missing data in corruption_index etc.

### Literature 
Literature review on previous research on the correlation between corruption rate and the number of piracy attacks in Nigeria/other countries => for reference, for backup. For relevance support, dataset: corruption index - what is it, how? Problems/Limits

### Plan
To meet up monday, 19:30ish - 

## Task division
=> Workflow step = Collection
- Data (table, graph, analysis) - Savio, Marleen
- Literature - see literature, at least three relevant articles; to support correlation corruption/piracy, Nigeria: Yasha, Lucille. By Monday
- Portfolio - initial design, write workflow, - Hannah, Linh

#### Workflow steps:
Monitoring and execution

#### Description:
Group came together collectively to discuss and review what steps have been completed, what steps still need to be taken. 
The comments were: 

  We have: 
- The correlation > answer to the research question
- Literature to support choice RQ
- Literature to explain the type of correlation>discussion

We need:
- What is the ‘end shape’ of our project?
- What does our data correlation look like? - format, why?
- What are the limitations we have dealt with (and still deal with)?
- Write Project documentation and workflow
- Create presentation slides for final presentation

Tasks were divided concerning the Project Documentation as follows: 
- Project overview (Linh and Hannah)
- Data acquisition (Marleen and Sávio)
- Methodology (Marleen and Sávio)
- Workflow steps (Linh and Hannah)
- Challenges and Solutions (Linh and Hannah)
- Ethical considerations  (Lucille and Yasha)	
- Results (Lucille - Yasha)	
- Documentation and Sustainability (Marleen and Sávio)
- Reflection (All)

The division of labor was based on the tasks we had assigned to ourselves in previous meetings and are based on personal strengths.

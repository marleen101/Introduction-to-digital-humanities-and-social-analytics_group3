#### RQ: To what extent does the corruption index of Nigeria correlate with the rate of piracy attacks on the country between 1993 and 2019? 
- We need to define: corruption index and decide which factors of the corruption index we will look at. 
- External or internal validity? Steps that we take, can be replicated by others. - There is a need for further research - we need to specify and be transparent so that there is replicability
- Why this country? Because of isolated geographical location & outside the hotspot (less chaotic)
- Nearest country -> is it always Nigeria? 
- Great recession: 2008, world wide event - check global and local correlations 
- Nigeria: 559 cases
- 1993 - 2019: as much as data points we have 
- Causation or correlation - correlation

##### Keep in mind:
- Keeping it simple
- We’re drifting away from our dataset
- Correlation between piracy attack and corruption index

#### Attack types distribution graph

### Readings Nigeria GDP/Piracy
- Nigeria is the second largest (largest ?) oil and gas producer in the African continent. Many of the maritime piracy cases in the Gulf of Guinea are related to the looting of oil transport vessels.

- Many of the articles seem to suggest that a significant part of Nigeria’s GDP is due to their oil industry and that in turn a significant part of their oil barrels are pirated. So therefore, a worthwhile question to raise might be “How does piracy affect GDP?” and not the other way around.

ARTICLE SPECIFICALLY ON THE EFFECT OF MARITIME PIRACY ON THE GDP OF NIGERIA

I believe the conclusion is that GDP decreases when maritime piracy happens in Nigerian waters.

Mentions that “In Nigeria, increasing attacks against oil transports may signal an effort by insurgents to use the profits from piracy as an additional revenue stream to fund their campaign against the Nigerian government. The article hypothesizes that piracy incidents, that is, actual acts of looting, increase the intensity of civil conflict.”
Suggests maritime piracy and regional/civil conflict (might) go hand in hand.

Mentions there is a lot of maritime insecurity in the region and that this is due to its decentralised nature, nations/countries need to work together to fight maritime piracy
Political commitment is required

More information about maritime piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, more specifically on Nigeria and the political situations, rebels and how these factors influence the surge in piracy cases in the region.

##### Barrios, C. (2013). Fighting piracy in the Gulf of Guinea: Offshore and onshore. European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS). http://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep06835

Mentions that, after there was a decline in the number of piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden, the Gulf of Guinea saw an increase. The article says Nigeria is the most affected country in the gulf of Guinea and that it is tied to the oil industry.
Is written from a European perspective, with EU financial incentives in mind.

##### Daxecker, U., & Prins, B. C. (2021). Pirate lands : governance and maritime piracy. Oxford University Press.
“The association between piracy and economic grievance appears stronger than the one with political violence. As per capita GDP increases, the likelihood of piracy decreases, lending weight to the argument that individual resource scarcity contributes to pirate recruitment. Figure 4.7 illustrates the relationship between average individual wealth in a country and maritime piracy.31 We show a distribution plot of piracy incidents across the full range of GDP per capita values in our dataset (1995-2015). The figure shows countries with per capita GDP values above $20,000 (2010 US $ experiencing almost no piracy in their wa-ters. The poorest 50% of countries see the vast majority of piracy that occurs in the international system, suggesting that pirate gangs capitalize on economic marginalization for recruitment.”

At a global level, as the GDP per capita increases, the number of piracy incidents decreases.

- Acknowledge that the true rate of piracy attacks in Nigeria/the Gulf of Guinea is higher than the statistic available due to underreporting.
- The Gulf of Guinea is the hotspot of contemporary piracy attacks, which is an important maritime transportation route.
- Nigeria is one of the largest oil-producing countries. This attracts many pirates to take the advantage of seizing natural resources and resell for higher profits.
- Owing to a relatively weak institution associated with corruption, youth unemployment, and poverty, Nigeria, especially the Niger Delta region, is highly vulnerable to marine crimes such as oil thefts.

This article is specifically focused on Nigeria. The result suggests that with a unit increase in GDP, piracy attacks decrease by 3.81 units.
